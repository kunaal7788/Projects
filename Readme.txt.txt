Thyroid Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a thyroid detection system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to analyze medical images of the thyroid gland and classify them as either normal or abnormal based on the presence of thyroid nodules or other abnormalities. The goal is to assist medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of thyroid-related conditions.

Features
Image Classification The system leverages machine learning algorithms implemented in JavaScript to classify medical images as normal or abnormal based on the presence of thyroid nodules or other abnormalities.
Preprocessing The project includes preprocessing techniques implemented in JavaScript to enhance the quality of the medical images and optimize them for analysis.
Model Training A deep learning model is trained offline using a dataset of labeled medical images to learn patterns and features indicative of thyroid abnormalities. The trained model is then loaded and used by the system.
Model Evaluation The performance of the trained model is evaluated offline using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in thyroid detection.
GUI Application The project includes a user-friendly graphical interface implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow medical professionals to upload and analyze medical images easily.
Performance Optimization Techniques like model optimization and image processing optimization are implemented to ensure efficient and accurate thyroid detection.
Documentation Detailed documentation is provided, including instructions for setting up the project, running the system, and interpreting the results.
Dependencies
No external dependencies are required for this project as it is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

Usage
Clone the project repository git clone httpsgithub.comusernamethyroid-detection-project.git
Navigate to the project directory cd thyroid-detection-project
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Use the web interface to upload medical images for thyroid detection.
View the classification results and any detected abnormalities.
